# Marmalade
![](resources/images/banner.png)

Marmalade is a small game library targeting the web.

It provides :
- A 2d rendering context with an intermediate abstraction level (somewhere between [macroquad](https://github.com/not-fl3/macroquad) and raw webgl)
- A simple way of loading and playing sounds
- Easy input handling

It will (probably) provide in the future :
- A 3d rendering context
- A WebGPU backend to replace WebGL once the API is stable

It won't :
- Support any other platform than HTML5 so that it can stay small and simple while being portable (It should however be possible to make a native app with the help of [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/) or [Tauri](https://tauri.app))
- Hide rust specific complexity. You may need to use Rc, Cells and play with lifetimes for example

## How to use
